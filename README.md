# mazeSolver

This is a visual maze solver which uses the TKinter library in Python.

It will draw a maze on screen and then implement an algorithm to systematically solve the maze and draw a line to show you the progress.

# Instructions
To run this make sure you have python 3 installed as well as the TKinter library, the command below will install the TKinter library.
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
Assuming you have python3 and TKinter installed clone down the repo, or fork and clone, navigate to the project folder and run the following command
```bash
python3 main.py
```
This should open a window similar to the screenshots below and run the maze solver.
